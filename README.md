# Extract vectors from PDF to SVG

This app enables extracting regions in a PDF file, such as a diagram, or chart,
or an algorithm, using the vector data in the PDF into an SVG file, which scales
losslessly.

Typical alternative approaches of extracting diagrams and charts from PDF files
(such as research papers) involve taking a screenshot and converting it to a
raster image such as JPG, PNG, WebP, AVIF, or similar, which unfortunately
become pixelated when zooming in or scaling them larger to examine fine-grained
details.
